## Objective
The ReLacks site was created to help people exchange goods in which we believe is a safer and easier manner. Today people can post their goods usng Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist however searching for goods is cumbersome and you don't know how trust worthy the person is on the other end.
This site will allow the user to post their goods they want to give away, assign a category to it, and indicate a meeting point for the exchange. A potential receiver can search via category or for the direct item. When the receiver finds the item, he/she can indicate they want the item with a click of a button. The giver can now specify an address to meet for the exchange.  After the exchange is made, the parties can rate each other.
